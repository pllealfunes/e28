## Pages & SFC summary
ListCount.vue is the only SFC and everything else are my "pages"
  
## Server interaction
*List the features in your application that are persisting and retrieving data from the server*
All four CRUD operations are used in the application.
Create - CreatePage
Read - Recipes and Recipe page
Update - Edit Page
Delete - Recipe Page

## Outside resources
* Used this information to add an Ingrediant to the Shopping List: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49530453/vue-js-javascript-create-new-object-onclick-with-one-value-being-the-value-of-t
* Used this information to help format my error messages on my Create Page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46970642/how-to-display-error-message-in-front-end-using-vue-js

## Notes for instructor
Error messages will not display on the Edit Page if a field is left blank but will still update the recipe even with a blank space. There isn't a way to delete an item from the shopping list.
